# Dating App Management System

This repository contains all the materials related to the "Dating App Management System" , developed as part of a comprehensive academic endeavor. This system is designed to enhance user safety and improve user experience on dating platforms by integrating advanced fraud detection mechanisms.

## Project Overview

The Dating App Management System aims to address the rise in fraudulent activities on dating platforms, such as financial scams and identity theft, by developing a robust Fraud Detection database. This system proactively identifies and mitigates fraudulent activities, thereby creating a safer and more enjoyable dating environment.

### Features

- **Profile Management**: Users can create profiles, upload photos, and enter personal preferences to facilitate connections.
- **Fraud Detection**: Implements mechanisms to flag and monitor suspicious activities, enhancing safety across the platform.
- **Interactive Questionnaire**: Captures comprehensive user data to improve match suggestions.
- **Comprehensive User Interactions**: Supports likes, matches, conversations, and user reports to manage interactions effectively.

## System Requirements

1. **Single Account Per User**: Ensures that each user has only one account per email and phone number combination.
2. **Interaction Management**: Users can block or un-match and manage multiple conversations with unique users.
3. **Subscription and Payments**: Supports multiple payment methods but restricts payment transactions to one method at a time.

## Data Model

- **User Management**: Handles user data including personal details and preferences.
- **Subscription and Payment**: Manages user subscriptions and payment transactions.
- **Interaction Logs**: Tracks likes, matches, and user interactions to facilitate efficient user engagement.

## Implementation

### SQL

- Utilizes MySQL for structured data storage and management.
- Advanced SQL queries for data aggregation, joins, and subqueries.

### NoSQL

- MongoDB for flexible data handling and querying.
- Implementation of aggregate functions and joins in a NoSQL environment.

### Python and Jupyter Notebook

- Data visualization using Python in Jupyter Notebooks.
- Analysis of user demographics, subscription details, and event participation.

## Visualization and Analysis

Graphical representations provide insights into user behavior, subscription metrics, and event participation, aiding in strategic decision-making and system enhancements.

## Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Plans to incorporate ML algorithms to refine user suggestions and analyze user behavior.
- **Enhanced Fraud Detection**: Continuous improvement of the fraud detection algorithms to adapt to new types of fraudulent activities.

## Conclusion

The Dating App Management System represents a significant step forward in enhancing the safety and usability of online dating platforms. The integration of advanced data management techniques and user-centered functionalities ensures a secure and engaging environment for users.
